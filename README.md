# Overview

I decided to recreate the retro game called Pong! It is the one where there are two paddles on each side of the screen and there is a ball bouncing back and forth in the middle. If the ball goes past one paddle, the other paddle gets a point. I mad it so the right side paddle is an ai that progressively gets harder as the rounds go on. The left side is the user. The user can control the paddle with either the arrow key or the "w" key to go up or "s" key to go down.

I decided to write this software because I remember playing this game a long time ago. It popped up in my head and I figured I should try to recreate it. It has always been a good classic game for me!

# Future Work

* I would like to add a feature where you can choose either two players or go against the ai
* I would like to add a rally count to keep track of how many hits each player takes
